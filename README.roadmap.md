# **vanam** Roadmap

This roadmap describes a staged progression from a minimal capture tool to a global tree registry. Statements about feasibility and impact are opinion, informed by existing biodiversity, mapping, and civic registry systems.

(✅ = DONE)

## v0 — Individual Tree Capture ✅

*Enable anyone with a smartphone to record a tree as a structured, geo-referenced observation with minimal effort.*

- ✅ Mobile-first web application.
- ✅ Camera-based image capture.
- ✅ Automatic GPS latitude and longitude from device sensors.
- ✅ Species identification via an external service, e.g. PlantNet.
- ✅ Storage of image metadata, timestamp, and location.
- ✅ Offline-first behaviour with deferred upload.
- ✅ No mandatory login or identity.
- ✅ Data stored in simple, portable formats, e.g. JSON, GeoJSON.

## v1 — Personal and Community Inventories

*Turn individual observations into coherent inventories that people and communities can curate over time.*

- Optional user accounts with minimal personal data.
- Ability to group observations into collections, walks, sites, or projects.
- Editing and correction of observations after capture.
- Explicit confidence levels for species identification.
- Manual species selection and override.
- Detection and merging of likely duplicate observations.
- Persistent identifiers for recorded trees and observations.
- Full change history and attribution.
- Clear data licensing, open by default.
- Basic visualisation, maps, counts, simple summaries.

## v2 — National Tree Registry

*Create an authoritative, continuously updated registry of trees within Sri Lanka, suitable for public, scientific, and policy use.*

- Distinction between tree entities and individual observations.
- Stable national tree identifiers.
- Support for multiple observations per tree over time.
- Integration with national species taxonomies and red lists.
- Geographic hierarchy, administrative boundaries, reserves, roads.
- Role-based permissions, public contributors, trusted reviewers, institutions.
- Expert validation workflows.
- Quality scoring and provenance metadata.
- Scalable infrastructure supporting millions of records.
- Public read access via documented APIs.
- Data suitable for reporting on canopy cover, biodiversity, and deforestation.

## v3 — Global Tree Identity System

*Establish a globally interoperable system in which trees are persistent entities with identity, history, and measurable change over time.*

- Globally unique tree identifiers.
- Federated architecture across countries and organisations.
- Alignment with international biodiversity and geospatial standards.
- Cross-registry species and taxonomy reconciliation.
- Time-series support, growth, health, damage, removal.
- Integration with satellite, aerial, and sensor data.
- Automated anomaly and loss detection.
- Fine-grained access control for sensitive locations and species.
- Clear governance, stewardship, and long-term sustainability model.
- Mechanisms to balance open data with ecological protection.

# Vanam

**vanam** is a mobile-first web app for cataloguing trees.

Point your phone at a plant, take a photo, and vanam records it as a structured observation with:

- GPS latitude and longitude
- Species identification via PlantNet
- Image and contextual metadata

The goal is simple: make it easy to build accurate, geo-referenced tree inventories, one plant at a time.

The name **vanam** comes from Sanskrit (वनम्), meaning *forest*.

vanam runs entirely in the browser and is designed for field use. It favours practicality over polish and data over decoration.

# Vanam

**vanam** is a web app for cataloguing trees.

Point your phone at a plant, take a photo, and vanam records it as a structured observation with:

- GPS latitude and longitude
- Species identification via PlantNet
- Image and contextual metadata

The goal is simple: make it easy to build accurate, geo-referenced tree inventories, one plant at a time.

The name *vanam* comes from Sanskrit, meaning forest, and is also the root of the Sinhala word *vanaya* (වනය) and the Tamil word *vanam* (வனம்), both meaning forest.

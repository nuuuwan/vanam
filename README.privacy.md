# Privacy Policy for vanam

**Last updated:** 10 January 2026

## 1. Overview

vanam is a free web application for recording tree observations. This policy explains what data is collected, why it is collected, and how it is handled.

## 2. Data You Provide

When you use vanam, you may provide:

- Photographs of plants  
- GPS latitude and longitude  
- Optional notes or contextual information attached to an observation  

This is factual data about plants and locations. It may incidentally include personal data if you photograph people, private property, or identifiable features. That is your responsibility.

## 3. Automatically Collected Data

vanam may automatically collect:

- Basic technical data, such as browser type and device information  
- Timestamps associated with observations  

This data is used for basic functionality and debugging, not profiling.

## 4. Species Identification

Plant photos may be sent to a third-party plant identification service, PlantNet, for species recognition.

- What is sent: the image you submit  
- What is received: species identification results  

This processing is required for the core function of the app. vanam does not control PlantNet’s data handling. You should review their privacy policy separately. This is fact, not opinion.

## 5. Location Data

GPS coordinates are collected explicitly to create geo-referenced tree records.

- Purpose: mapping and inventory accuracy  
- Precision: as provided by your device  

Location data is not collected in the background. It is only captured when you create an observation.

## 6. Data Storage

Observation data may be stored in public or semi-public datasets if you choose to share or publish it.

- There is no guarantee of confidentiality for shared observations  
- Unshared data may still be visible to the app operator for maintenance  

This is a design choice, not a promise of anonymity.

## 7. Cookies and Tracking

vanam does not knowingly use advertising cookies or cross-site tracking.

Standard web hosting or analytics tools may collect minimal usage data. This is operational, not commercial.

## 8. Data Sharing

vanam does not sell your data.

Data is only shared:

- With PlantNet for species identification  
- If you explicitly export, publish, or share observations  

No third-party marketing access is permitted.

## 9. Data Retention

Data is retained for as long as the app and its storage infrastructure exist, unless you delete it or request deletion.

There is no guaranteed retention schedule. This is a limitation, not an oversight.

## 10. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:

- Access your data  
- Correct inaccuracies  
- Request deletion  

As this is a free, non-commercial project, responses may be best-effort rather than guaranteed.

## 11. Children

vanam is not designed for children. No age verification is performed. If children use the app, it is at the discretion and responsibility of their guardians.

## 12. Changes to This Policy

This policy may change without notice. Continued use of the app means you accept the current version.

## 13. Contact

For questions or data requests, contact the app maintainer via the project repository or website linked from the app.

No support response times are promised.
